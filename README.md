### Welcome to My Profile!ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm a Master of Science in Computer Science graduate, with a specialization in Big Data Systems from Arizona State University. I earned my degree in December 2023, achieving a 3.8 GPA. Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science at SRM Institute of Science and Technology in India.

During my stint as a Data Engineer at ASU, I honed my skills in automating data processes with Python and AWS Lambda, which significantly reduced processing times. I deployed ElasticSearch on AWS, which proved crucial for handling massive document indexing and supporting complex queries. My efforts also extended to scaling data pipelines using various AWS services, enhancing database performance, and implementing CI/CD workflows for more efficient deployment processes.

Before my role at ASU, I worked as a Software Engineer I at Vanenburg in India, where I improved our SaaS analytics platform's efficiency by integrating MongoDB into AWS and managed a JavaScript-based API using Agile methodologies. Additionally, I established secure authentication systems and robust ETL pipelines, contributing to the company's technological growth.

My academic projects include developing a COVID-19 Data Visualization Dashboard and building an Android app for the real-time classification of handwritten digits. Deep Vision, another project, involved enhancing image recognition with machine learning.

With a strong foundation in programming languages like Java, JavaScript, Python, and C++, and frameworks like React.js and Flask, I am also proficient in database and cloud technologies. My AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate certification is a testament to my cloud expertise.

I'm always open to connect and discuss innovative ideas in technology!
